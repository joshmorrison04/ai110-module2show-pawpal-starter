# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Smarter Scheduling Features

- Tasks are ordered by due time (unscheduled tasks come last).
- Plans can be filtered by pet or task status.
- Daily and weekly recurring tasks are supported.
- Conflicts are detected for overlapping tasks and tasks sharing the same due time.

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing PawPal+

Run tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

This test suite verifies:

- Task sorting by due time
- Recurring task logic (daily/weekly)
- Conflict detection (overlaps and same-time)
- Task CRUD and validation (duration/priority, completion)

Confidence Level: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)
Sorting, status/pet filtering, and daily/weekly recurrence are solid, but conflict detection is basic and availability limits may skip lower-priority tasks without rescheduling.

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.
